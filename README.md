# Snippet Editor for ExpressionEngine 2

The editor for snippets and global variables that you've been waiting for - with revisions saved and code highlighted!

Snippets and Global Variables in ExpressionEngine are great - but bad thing about them is that built-in editor does not support revisions/versioning. So if you occationally save snippet or variable with wrong contents - there is no way to revert.

Now with Snippet Editor module it’s over! Don’t worry about your data anymore - simply enable template revisions in EE Template Preferences, and revision for snippets and global variables are saved each time you edit!

As an extra feature, you can colorize the Snippet Editor using built-in syntax code highlighter.
